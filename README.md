# Welcome to the Data Analytics GitHub for the 2024 Full Stack Data Workshops!

My name is [Sam LaFell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samlafell/) and I'm a graduate of the Institute for Advanced Analytics (IAA) class of 2020. This is where I began to learn in-depth about Data Analytics.

I've been working mostly as a Data Scientist over the last few years, but in August 2023, I transitioned into more Data Platform and Data Engineering work in the Pharma space.

I have been across many different parts of the data lifecycle, and want to help those just starting out put some pieces together around this who big crazy world of data.

## Pre-Requistes and Assumptions about who you are

You are a beginner in this crazy world of Data. You might know SQL or Python, or you might not. These next few months/classes will cover some fundamentals of Data Analytics.

_NOTE:_ Having Python knowledge will help, as we will do our explorations of Datasets in Python.

You do not need a technical background.

If you are here with a technical background, take it as an opportunity to stretch your creative muscles. The best technical assets have at least some level of creativity around problem solving that is very useful for organizations.

## Tools Used in the Data Analytics Workshops

- Python
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index)
- GitHub/Git
    - Minimally, mostly just to access course materials or code I want to give to you all


## How to get the most out of this workshop

Come to all 3 sessions, as they will connect and relate to each other.

Come to the Data Science workshops in Q3, as we will try to build on what we've done in Q2 to eventually create a Machine Learning model with the work we've done.

## What is Analytics?

Ultimately, Data Analytics is the use of data to guide business decisions based on historical facts and performance.

A Few Key Elements:
- Guide: You are almost never the one making the decision. You make the recommendation.

- Business Decisions: You can help the business make more money or save more money. Everything ties back to dollars.

- Historical Facts & Performance: You are analyzing data in the past. You do *not* make predictions about the future. You want to report trends, call out anamolies, and help the business identify areas for opportunity.

## Successful Data Analysts

A successful data analyst has a very broad definition. There are a few main traits I consider to be fundamental for someone to be a successful data analyst:

1. Curious: Your greatest asset as an Analyst is asking questions. Those questions turn into hypotheses. These turn into experiments.

2. Detail Oriented: Every job posting ever lists this as a skill you need. So, how does it apply?
- Since your curiosity leads you to ask questions that ultimately turn into experiemnts, you have to know what to look for.
- Analytics really focuses in on performance metrics and KPIs. This requires data cleaning, transoformations to get data in the right format, and some light calculations (usually done in SQL)

3. SQL: You don't need to know C++ or Python or Java to be a successful analyst. Your toolkit could only consist of SQL (+ Git and a Viz tool), and you would be just fine.

4. Communication: Remember back to asking questions? Creating hypotheses and experiments? All of this requires buy-in from people that can approve those experiments (the time and money spent on them). This also requires you to learn about the business (listening) and understand how levers move together. All this pretty much falls into Communication, and your ability to work in a team.

## Let's Get Started
I'm excited to work with you over the next few months and workshops to help us become better Data Analysts.
