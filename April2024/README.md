## Objectives for today

## Introducing Our Dataset
I've already got a dataset picked out for us. It is stored in the data/ folder in the GitHub.

I'd ask that you stick to using this Dataset, but if you want to use another, it's fine! Just make sure that you pick one that has >10 columns, and has informations about customers of some kind.

This Dataset is around shopping trends for a company that sells many different types of clothing and non-clothing items for both men and women.

We will start by asking some simple questions around what our columns look like, what our data contains, and start documenting some questions we could look into for next time
